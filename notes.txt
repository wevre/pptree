:section Introduction

   Takes a list of paths from stdin and produces a printout similar to *nix
   `tree` command. Includes options to control sorting and to specify the path
   separator.

:section ToDo's

   [] I'm looking at `lines<-tree` and I'm thinking two things: (1) the mutual
   recursion could probably be "unwound" back to single recursion--sort of what
   to do that just to see what it would look like and if it would make the code
   easier to grok at a glance; and, (2) I still want to try for some elegant
   code using zippers. I've made some stabs at it, but each time, partway
   through, I started to feel like the code was getting more hairy.

:section Learnings

   * uberjar needs the main class compiled first
   ```
      clj -e "(compile 'wevre.pptree.main)".

   * for clj to compile, the `classes` directory needs to exist.
